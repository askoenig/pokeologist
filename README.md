### TECH
I built this project using:

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Vanilla CSS


### Rails Setup

git clone 

cd NYSee

bundle install 

rails db:create db:migrate 

rails s (start rails server) 

Now you can should be able to go to the url endpoints

### Creating A Rails Project
The project was originally generated with these commands:

- Create folder 
mkdir best-app

- cd into that folder 
cd best-app

- Update Rails Version rails 
v gem update rails

- Create new rails API with a PostgreSQL 
database rails new my_api --api --database=postgresql 
cd my_api 
rails g scaffold Book title:string (etc)

- Create a Git repo for Rails app
